								<p>There are a lot of supervised machine learning algorithms that can be used for classification. Likewise, decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm. The unique thing about this algorithm is that it is used
									to classify data that requires conditional control statement.In simpler words it can classify data which have different cases. It is also used in regression models in some cases.
                                </p>

                                <p>This program is the best one to shwocase my ability to write, test and debug an algorithm. This program was an assignment for my machine learning class. As such, not all of the program is
									written by me. However, I did write, test and debugged the core of the program which was the decision tree algorithm. While the core of this program was the algorithm there were different clases that were made used
									in the program. As such, this program helped me strengthen my object oriented concepts and improved my knowledge on the used algorithm.
                                </p>

								<p>This program was also a challenge for me. I ran into a lot of bugs due to incorrect implementation of the algorithm. But with enough trials and testing, I was able to pinpoint the mistakes
									and solve the bugs. The program really helped get better at debugging code and helped me understand how to optimize my code. I learned how to create different masks for objects and also got very
									familiar with list comprehensions in Python as well.
