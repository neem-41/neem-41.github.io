								<p>Spelling WIZ is a web-based game designed for kids. The goal of the game is to help improve spelling for students between grade 1-3.
                                    The larger aim of the game was to find a interactive way for students to learn and teachers to track the learning curve of students.
                                    In addition to that, the hope was that our program would also help students get familiar with computers. The general idea of the game
                                    is that there will be story with words that are scrambled as shown in the picture above. The students will click on the word and the 
                                    boxes with the letter for the word with appear on the screen. The students will then be able to move the boxes around until they find the right answer.
                                    Once the answer has been found, the word will turn green in the story and the letters for the next scrambled word will appear on the boxes.
                                    There is also a hint button that will solve some of the letters in the box for the students should they get stuck.
                                </p>

                                <p>This is one of the first web-based programs that I have written. This program showcases my ability to learn different programing language.
                                    Having almost no background for web development, I learned HTML, CSS and Javascript for this program. We used vanilla style web development for this,
                                    so everything here has been coded from scratch using those three languages and Java. In addition, I also got introduced to the concepts
                                    of APIs and server. Our team worked hard on the both the back end and front end for this, so the program also utilizes object-oriented language concept with the use of Heroku Database.
                                </p>
