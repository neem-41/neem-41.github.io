								<p>Pacman is a famous video game that gained its popularity as an arcade game. The way that the game is played is that there is a board
                                    with pacman (the player), ghosts and food. The goal of the game is to eat all the food on the board. The ghosts are the opposition to
                                    the player and try to stop players from eating the food. Once all food are eaten a new board pops up and the game repeats. If the ghosts
                                    are able to stop pacman, the game is lost and pacman restarts.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>Pacman is a very highly used game for algorithms and Artificial Intelligence (AI) classes. For this assignment, we used it as a way to learn 
                                    different algorithms to make an AI agent. The main idea behind this assignment was to implement an algorithm known as q-learning to our pacman
                                    agent. The top down concept is that our pacman agent plays a lot of games and learns from each failure and success in terms of values for the board.
                                    Then with enough learning, it will be able to predict values for different board and play well on those.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    If you are interested to learn more about q-learning you can follow this link <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning" target="_blank">here</a>.
                                </p>

                                <p>This is one of the first AI agents that I have coded. While the entire program is not written by me, I did add the code for the algorithms as per the assignment's direction.
                                    This assignment shows the depth of my understanding of the algorithm and my ability to utilize it in programs. Since parts of the program were already
                                    written for me, I had to look through each file and understand the concepts behind the scene. Then I had to write my part of the code so that it is compatible with the rest 
                                    of the program. This assignment not only helped me learn algorithms but also gave me a little bit of experience on adapting with someone else's code. It taught me
                                    valuable lessons like the need for standard formatting, the importance of code comments and data structure, etc. Altogether, this program shows my confidence
                                    in writing an AI agent.  
                                </p>

								<p>This project shows the system-level understanding of computers meaning it shows my ability to use computer to create a workable software. On top of that this project has given 
									me great expereince working on an individual project. This project was full of challenges that required solving different problems throughout the program like getting policies, Qvalues for the pacman agent. 
									My problems solving skill has also been demonstrated in this project.
