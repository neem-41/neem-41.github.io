								<p>As the name suggests, chatroom is an application where users can communicate with each other. This is mainly a group chatting application but also features sending private
									messages to people. The larger goal of the program was to create a protocol for the server such that any other application that followed the protocol could be used by the users.
									This means that different people could use different application to communicate as long as the protocol was followed. There are mainly three components to the program. The first
									one is the server, that processes all the messages sent. The rest of the components were on the client application which could send messages to everyone present in the chatroom
									and would show who are online in the chatroom. For this application, we did not use database so no registration is required to use this applicaiton. The only thing that a user needs
									to do is choose a nickname and they can join a runnning chatroom session.
                                </p>

                                <p>This project was my introduction to socket programming. From this project I learned how sockets work and how a client application communicates with a server application. On top of that,
									this program helped me understand the core concepts of protocols and its nessecity. As this project was written in Java, I learned how to use Socket API in Java as well. For this program, we firstly designed a protocol ourselves,
									and form that I understood the thinking process that goes on coming up with an unambiguous protocol. For this application we also use different threads to setup different client to server
									and server to client connections, so it showcases my ability to use threads.
                                </p>

								<p>This project really challenged me to push my understanding. We were using many concepts like sockets, threads, object oriented programming into a single application. As such, this project gave me
									a good experience to learn new things by implementing them into a program.
