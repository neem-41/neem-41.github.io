								<p>Air Canvas is a computer vision project, where users can write on a virtual whiteboard whithout the use of mouse of trackpads. Throughout the pandemic we saw how
									a normal classroom can quickly turn into a virutal boxes on a computer screen. Likewise, we also saw how a normal whiteboard can quickly turn into a virtual one where
									we write by using a mouse of a trackpad instead of a marker. While taking one class online, I realized how difficult it is to write with a mouse or a trackpad on a virtual
									whiteboard. This experience inspired me to try and create a computer vision application where one can write on a virtual space with just moving theirs fingers in air. The main
									goal of the project was to create an application that users can use with ease removing some of hurdles of using technologies. This project is the accumulation of my interest in 
									computer vision and also a test to see if ideas can be turned into actual code.
                                </p>

                                <p>This is not my first computer vision application, however this is my first compter vision application where I used live camera feed. This project was a great starting point
									to learn about computer vision packages for me. I have always been interested in fields like computer vision, machine learning and artificial intelligence. So, persuing
									this project helped me get familiar with packages like OpenCV, mediapipe, NumPy and made me realize and understand core concepts of using pixels. This project was fully written in Python.
                                </p>

								<p>This was one of the first projects that I wrote from scratch, so this project gave me some quality experience making an application by myself. Since, this was an individual project,
									I not only had to think about how to make the back end and front end, but also had to plan and revise the plans for both of them. On top of that, I had to think about how to
									structure my data/variables, how to differentiate what classes to make, etc. This was a fruitful project that really challenged my ability to code and helped me improve significantly.
								</p>

								<p>This project showcases my ability to use appropriate data structures to help solve a problem. On top of that I also created my own algorithm for drawing and using other functionality 
									of the program. So it is also a showcase of my ability to create, improve and test a new algorithm as well.
